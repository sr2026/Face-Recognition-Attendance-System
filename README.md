# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System

This project is all about Face Recognition Attendance System using OpenCV, Keras, and Haar Cascade classifiers. It captures face data from a camera stream, processes and consolidates images, trains a deep learning model, and finally recognizes faces in real-time to mark attendance.
